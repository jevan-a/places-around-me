    The Kamakshi Temple is an ancient Hindu Temple dedicated to Goddess Kamakshi. This temple is located in the historic city of Kanchipuram near Chennai. The Image of the main Deity, Kamakshi, is seated in a majestic Padmasana instead of a standing pose.
The Goddess Kamakshi prevails in the form of Shakti.
The Tamil saying Kanchi Kamakshi, Madurai Meenakshi and Kasi Visalakshi illustrates the importance of these Shakti shrines. There is a shrine for Adi Sankara also here in this temple. The temple is kept very clean.
We went to the temple on a Saturday morning and had our darshan within 30 minutes. There is no special entry tickets.. Queue system is good and fast.
